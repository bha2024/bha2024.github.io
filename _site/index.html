<h2>Welcome Biohackers!</h2>

<p>Bio-technological developments follow each other at a rapid pace. Inventions, such as the CRISPR-Cas9 technique that allows genetic editing of DNA, can have far-reaching consequences. The BioHack Academy promotes wider access to knowledge and tools outside institutional science and allows for a wider distribution of biotechnological skill. In the BioHack Academy the focus is on learning the basics of biotechnology, working with biomaterials and collaborate on building your own lab equipment.
In addition to gathering new knowledge, the BioHack Academy is also about sharing knowledge. All lab equipment manufactured within the BioHack Academy is open-source. This means that everyone is completely free to improve the design, adapt it according to their own preferences and continue experimenting.</p>

<p>This is the central Syllabus of the BioHack Academy 2024</p>
