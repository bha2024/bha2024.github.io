Welcome class!

Thanks a lot for embarking on this exciting journey into the world of biohacking. It's going to be an intense ride, simultaneously run with partner labs on three continents! By the end of the 10 weeks course you will become a true biohacker; a master in both bio and maker speak. Growing biomaterials in your own biofactory will become your second nature.

# Syllabus
Please take a look at the [Syllabus](http://biohackacademy.github.io). This website contains all the information you need to participate in the Academy. 

# General Preparations
Before we will welcome you in the Open Wetlab in Amsterdam, you need to take care of a few preparations. Once this is set, you are ready to hit the ground running on the 17th. 

Check out the [Preparations](/biofactory/preparations/) page to read about what needs to be done. 

> Please note: the Wetware section is only relevant to those of you who are planning to do experiments at home. If you plan to do experiments only in the Open Wetlab, we already got you covered.

# Preparations for Class 1 - Feb 17th
The instructions for the first class can be found in the Syllabus: [Incubator](/biofactory/class/1-incubator/). In order to start constructing the device right after the first lecture on Feb 17th, you will have to order the materials as suggested in the [Bill of Materials](/biofactory/class/1-incubator/incubator-materials/) as soon as possible. The chemicals and biological strains that we will use during the practical are available in the lab.

For each component on the list we suggested multiple online stores from which you can order. Please be ware of shipping times, and feel free to look for alternatives (in real stores) if needed. In case you have any questions, please use the Disqus commenting section at the bottom of the page as others might run into the same issues or take advantage of your findings.

> Please note:  The instructions for the second class [Microscope](/biofactory/class/2-microscope/), iincluding the materials list, can already be found in the Syllabus too, BUT will only be finalized next week. The instructions for the third class are ready in two weeks, etc. We still expect to make minor changes to the material lists, so ordering those materials in advance is at your own risk.

# Mailinglist
We are sending you this email through the mailinglist biohackacademy1@waag.org. You may also use this address in case you have something to share with all your fellow participants.

# Ready, Set, Go!
So just 2 more weeks left until we start! Please use the Disqus commenting sections in the Syllabus for any questions regarding the classes. For other questions, for example about payment, do not hesitate to contact pieter@waag.org

Good luck!
