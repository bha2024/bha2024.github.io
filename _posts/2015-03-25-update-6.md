Dear BioHackers,

This is your weekly update mail, starting with some exciting news! Gerrit, who has been participating on his own by remote thus far will join us next week in the lab. Let's give him a warm welcome on Monday!

Another important thing to notice is the change in structure of the lab days for next week. Instead of group workshops we will start with one-on-one coaching sessions. During these session I can help you out with specific challenges you are dealing with, such as designing your experiments, building hardware and documentation. Please take a close look at the schedule below to find out what time slot has been allocated to you. In case you prefer some different time slot, just let me know.

Apart from these one-on-one meetings the lab will be open to you both days. Don't forget to reserve the fablab machines, in case you intend to use them: http://biohackacademy.github.io/biofactory/annex/machine-equipment-guide/

# Assigment 
This week you have only one assignment:

1) Design the dimensions and fluxes of your bioreactor

# Contact details and examples of R端diger
Yesterday evening our Graduation Board member R端diger Trojok joined the lecture. Here is the info he promised to send you guys:

"I want to refer to cooking recipes.
Everyone knows granmas best recipes and most of the times these are described in awesome old fashioned cookbooks. They are short, clear and give you necessary information with an adequat requirement for pre-learned knowledge. Here two pages describing recipe writing:
http://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Recipe
http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-write-a-recipe-58522
Of course not all rules can be applied to biotech, but it is a good  inspiration what to look after. Additionally, people can add all sorts of academic style writing elements to their protocol if they want to go pro."

Here are some of my favorites:
Protocol: Yeastograms: http://pavillon35.polycinease.com/recipe-1-yeastograms/
Protocol: Mud batteries: http://www.instructables.com/id/Create-your-own-mud-battery-Bouw-je-eigen-modderba/
Hardware documentation: RWXBioFuge: https://github.com/PieterVanBoheemen/RWXBioFuge

For additional information on BioCommons, SYNENERGENE and other work by R端diger you can contact him by email: "R端diger Trojok" <rt@openbioprojects.net>

# Pumps
Again we published the design of a new lab utility two weeks in advance of the lecture. This time you may choose from two different pump designs. The syringe pump is most useful for small fed batch reactors, while the peristaltic pumps are most often used for chemostats.

Go ahead and order the components as listed in the Bill of Materials, or seek your own alternatives.

# Slides & videos 
Our videoproducer Hany was ill today, so the videos are not online yet. You will receive an update once we made them available.
The slides of last night can be found in the syllabus:

See you next week,

The BHA Team
