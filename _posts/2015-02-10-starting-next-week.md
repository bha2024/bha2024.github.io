# Preparations for Class 2: Microscopy

The instructions for the second class have now also been finalized. To build a microscope we will hack existing equipment. You can either choose to take apart a webcam or use the lenses of single use cameras to build a compound microscope, or both! 

There are separate Bill of Materials listed for each device in the Syllabus:

# Hacking

Perhaps needless to say, but remember that all the designs that we offering you are merely suggestions. You are welcome to make your own or adjust the designs in any way you like.

# Questions or remarks

Some of you already started to use the Disqus commenting system on the Syllabus. Remember to feel free to post any questions or remarks there regarding the content of the course.

All the best,

Pieter, Maria, Hany and Lucas
