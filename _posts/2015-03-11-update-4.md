# Centrifuge
The design, code and material list of the centrifuge has been finalized and can now be found in the Syllabus.

We decided to save the code and design files in a separate repository, to take full advantage of Github and keep better track of versions:
https://github.com/BioHackAcademy/BHA_Centrifuge

# Assignments and weekly assignment meeting
Most of you have already completed the first assignment: setting up a documentation site. In case your site is not yet on the list, please send me the link:
http://biohackacademy.github.io/biofactory/participants/documentation/

From now on we will have a weekly "Assignment Meeting" on Tuesday at 13:30h. During the meeting everybody gets five minutes to present their progress and we'll take a look at the outcomes of the assignments. I hope you will all succeed in recording a movie of your favorite microbe and post it on your documentation site.

The new assignment is: design a personal laboratory tool using the 3D / 2D techniques that were discussed last night. This is your chance to create a simple personal tube rack, microscope slide container or something far more sophisticated that I am sure you will come up with! 

# Blog post & Fun stuff
We posted a blog with some pictures on the Waag website. Please feel free to write a blog too. The Waag site has > 3 million visitors a year, so it's worth writing for:

Don't forgot to take a look at the fun stuff page regularly to see what others are up to, and please add any cool pictures or links to your documentation site:

# Lecture documentation
The PDFs of last night's lecture are already on the Syllabus. We also posted the OpenSCAD and Sketchup files of the Tube Rack:

The videos are on their way to the [Biohack Academy channel](https://vimeo.com/channels/880445).

Good luck,

The BioHack Academy Team
